# LathMartensite
A new perspective on the formation of Lath Martensite

# Abstract

A mathematical framework is proposed to predict the features of the (5 5 7) lath transformation in
low-carbon steels based on energy minimisation. This theory generates a one-parameter family of possible habit
plane normals and a selection mechanism then identifies the (5 5 7) normals as those arising from a deformation
with small atomic movement and maximal compatibility. While the calculations bear some resemblance
to those of double shear theories, the assumptions and conclusions are different. Interestingly, the predicted
microstructure morphology resembles that of plate martensite, in the sense that a type of twinning mechanism
is involved.
